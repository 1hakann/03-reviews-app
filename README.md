React project 3: Review This project deploy here Review App: https://1hakann.github.io/03-reviews-app/

To clone the project git clone https://github.com/1hakann/03-review-app.git In the project directory, you can run: npm run start Node must be installed to run the project.

This app aims to show the user by pulling the values in our json object. For this, before and after buttons have been added. Also the surprise me button fetches random content.

Creating the application and css steps are similar to previous projects. Review component has been created. Here we used icons as a new feature. We have installed our package. And we imported the icons we want to use.

Then we created our methods for our buttons. We wrote functions such as our previous and next buttons and giving random content. We also organized the files in our project hierarchically.

Deployment
Now it's time to deploy.

For this, let's add a homepage to package.json. Let's add git remote set-url as origin. Then let's add the predeploy and deploy commands to the scripts. Now let's do npm install gh-pages --save-dev. Now let's perform the build and then deploy operations. That is all.

See you in the next app. Goodbye! Stay with the code...
