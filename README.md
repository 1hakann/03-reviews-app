This app aims to show the user by pulling the values in our json object. For this, before and after buttons have been added. Also the surprise me button fetches random content.

Creating the application and css steps are similar to previous projects. Review component has been created. Here we used icons as a new feature. We have installed our package. And we imported the icons we want to use.

Then we created our methods for our buttons. We wrote functions such as our previous and next buttons and giving random content. We also organized the files in our project hierarchically.
